###  Description

**ALL ESSENTIAL ECOMMERCE FEATURES IN A SINGLE, FULLY INTEGRATED PLUGIN**

On average, WooCommerce store owners rely on 20+ plugins to run their sites. But using so many plugins can be expensive, put a drag on site performance, and lead to compatibility issues between plugins.

[Merchant](https://athemes.com/merchant/) solves these problems by consolidating all of the features a modern store needs into one, performance-optimized plugin.
