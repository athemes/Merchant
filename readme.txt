== Description ==

== ALL ESSENTIAL FEATURES IN A SINGLE, FULLY INTEGRATED PLUGIN ==

Merchant is an all-in-one WooCommerce plugin designed to boost sales and grow your WooCommerce store. Packed with 15 modules, including **Pre-Orders, Buy Now Button, Product Labels, Trust Badge, Payment Logos, Quick View, Animated Add to Cart, Cart Count Favicon, Inactive Tab Message, Real-Time Search, Auto External Links, Scroll to Top Button, Agree to Terms Checkbox, Cookie Banner, Code Snippets,** and more to come.

Consolidate modern eCommerce features into a single, performance-optimized plugin. Save money and do more to grow your business.

According to our estimates, on average, store owners rely on 20+ plugins to run their stores. We see three key issues with this approach:

**1. It's expensive:** Purchasing multiple plugins can quickly add up and become costly. Most plugins operate on a subscription-based model, which means you need to factor in significant yearly renewal costs. These multiple subscriptions can put a substantial financial burden on store owners.

**2. Poor performance:** Unfortunately, many WooCommerce plugins lack a performance-first mindset. They often include excessive CSS and JavaScript files, resulting in significantly slower loading times for websites.

**3. Lack of compatibility:** Often, plugins don't play nicely together or with the underlying theme. This leads to spending a lot of time solving bugs and contacting different developers. Moreover, the support provided is often slow and unresponsive, further exacerbating store owners' frustrations.

So we created Merchantâ€¦

Combining all essential eCommerce features into a single solution. With 15 powerful modules and more to come, Merchant eliminates the need to purchase multiple separate plugins.

Let's take a closer look at some of the modules that make Merchant the ultimate choice for WooCommerce store owners:

### BOOST REVENUE
**Pre-Orders:** Generate more revenue by allowing visitors to pre-order products that are either out of stock or not yet released.

### BUILD TRUST
**Trust Badge:** Enhance trust and boost conversion rates with premium, professionally-designed badges that match your store's look and feel.

**Payment Logos:** Build trust by displaying a wide assortment of payment method logos to let visitors know you accept various payment options.

### CONVERT MORE
**Buy Now:** Streamline the purchase process by directing customers straight to checkout instead of the cart.

**Animated Add to Cart:** Make your "Add to Cart" button stand out by adding a subtle animation on hover or at intervals.

**Product Labels:** Increase conversion rates with sale tags displayed on top of your product images.

**Quick View:** Allow users to quickly view product details without leaving the current page.

### REDUCE ABANDONMENT
**Cart Count Favicon:** Highlight the number of items in the cart on your store's browser tab favicon to capture attention.

**Inactive Tab Message:** Minimize cart abandonment by dynamically modifying the browser tab's title when visitors navigate away from your store.

### IMPROVE EXPERIENCE
**Auto External Links:** Open all external links on your store in a new browser tab to prevent visitors from navigating away.

**Real-Time Search:** Help visitors instantly find the products they're looking for by providing predictive search and displaying frequent search suggestions.

**Code Snippets:** Add custom code snippets in WordPress without having to edit your theme's functions.php file.

**Scroll to Top:** Assist customers in easily returning to the top of the page where they can view product photos and purchase options.

### PROTECT YOUR BUSINESS
**Agree to Terms Checkbox:** Display a checkbox with a link to your storeâ€™s terms and conditions 

**Cookie Banner:** Inform visitors that your site uses cookies.
