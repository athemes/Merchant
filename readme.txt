### A QUICK LOOK AT ALL FREE MODULES (16 AND COUNTING)

Let's take a closer look at what each module offers, along with how it can improve your WooCommerce store.

**1. BOOST REVENUE**

**Pre-Orders**: Boost your revenue by giving customers the option to pre-order upcoming products and/or out-of-stock products.

**2. CONVERT MORE**

**Product Labels**: Attract attention to products and drive sales by adding eye-catching labels to the product images on your shop pages. 

**Buy Now**: As popularized by Amazon, this module lets you reduce friction in your store’s purchase process by skipping the cart page and sending shoppers straight from the product page to the checkout.

**Quick View**: Make it easier for customers to view product details without leaving their current page by adding product quick view functionality to your store.

**Animated Add to Cart**: Make your add to cart button stand out with subtle animations designed to increase customer engagement. Choose from 10+ different animations, as well as whether to activate the animation on mouseover or on page load.

**Add To Cart Text:** Change the text on your store's 'Add to Cart' buttons for simple, variable, and out-of-stock products, as well as individual products.

**3. REDUCE CART ABANDONMENT**

**Cart Count Favicon**: Re-capture shoppers’ attention and reduce cart abandonment by dynamically highlighting the number of cart items in the browser tab favicon.

**Inactive Tab Message**: Minimize cart abandonment and encourage users to return to your store by dynamically modifying the browser tab title when users move to a different browser tab.

**4. BUILD TRUST**

**Trust Badge**: According to Baymard, 18% of users who abandoned their carts cited trust issues as the reason, which made it the fourth-most common cart abandonment cause. Enhance trust with badges that match your store's look and feel.

**Payment Logos**: Adding payment logos is a great way to reassure shoppers that you support a wide range of payment methods. Easily display the payment methods that you accept.

**5. IMPROVE EXPERIENCE**

**Real-Time Search**: Upgrade your WooCommerce product search with real-time predictive search results and frequently searched term suggestions.

**Clear Cart**: Allow customers to easily clear their carts and start fresh.

**Scroll to Top**: Let your shoppers easily navigate back to the top of your site’s pages, which can help create a smooth browsing experience for your store.

**Auto External Links**: Eliminate the need to manually set external links to open in a new tab. Instead, the module will automatically configure all external links to open in a new tab.

**Code Snippets**: Easily add custom code snippets to your store without needing to modify your theme’s files directly. Add snippets to the header, body, or footer of your site.

**6. PROTECT STORE**

**Agree to Terms Checkbox**: This module lets you obtain agreement to your terms and conditions from your shoppers during the checkout process. 

**Cookie Banner**: Inform visitors that your site uses cookies. Add a floating or fixed cookie consent banner, along with options to fully customize the style and behavior of the box.

With these 15 modules, you can boost your store’s sales, reduce cart abandonment, improve the shopping experience, and more. Best of all, you can do this while simplifying your store’s technology stack.

> For me, the key selling point of either of these versions, whether it’s the free one or the Pro, is that it means I’ve only got one plugin to maintain and update (and purchase, if I go for the Pro version) over having multiple plugins to maintain, purchase and update. This just makes life a little easier.
